## üìÇ: CONFIGURATION

- **cache folder**  
  temporary directory where files are processed, the script automatically cleans the directory. 


- **dz-db folder**  
  music information database directory, the database is updated with each script run. 


- **logs folder**  
  all system logs are stored in this directory and restarted with each run for better space and process control.


- **recycle-bin folder**  
  directory where unnecessary thumbnails and corrupted files are moved. The directory stores files for 7 days, check the files you want to check within this period.

  
- **unofficial-albums folder**  
  this directory stores albums and playlists added to the artist that are not official. The directory stores the albums for 7 days, if you wish, you can retrieve the albums and manually move them to your library within this period. 
  **ATTENTION:** if you save the albums to your library, move them to a folder other than /music , because if you do, the unofficial album will be moved again to the unofficial albums directory the next time the script is run.


- **archive.txt**  
  records downloaded music IDs, delete to re-download all.


- **args.conf**  
  stores `yt-dlp` arguments, customizable for different needs.


- **artists.txt**  
  location: `/config/artists.txt`. artist list or playlist URLs to download.
  
  adding a new link by .txt editing:
  ```plaintext
  # ARTIST NAME
  https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCkrV3aukHg-BB2xT8D3Hwyw
  ```
  adding a new link by docker command:
  ```plaintext
  docker exec youtube-dl bash -c 'echo "# ARTIST NAME" >> ./artists.txt'
  docker exec youtube-dl bash -c 'echo "https://music.youtube.com/channel/UCkrV3aukHg-BB2xT8D3Hwyw" >> ./artists.txt'
  ```

- **genres_cache.txt**  
  this cache is built through an API and applied to the artist's musical style. If you do not agree with the information provided by the api, you can modify the .txt file and apply what you think is correct and the system will apply the artist genre tag to whatever is contained in the cache file without overwriting what was changed.


- **loudnorm_cache.txt**  
  this cache file stores the files already processed by ffmpeg, if you want to reprocess your library, delete this file.


- **loudnorm_failed_files_cache.txt**  
  this cache stores library files that were corrupted and removed by the system. If this file appears in your /config, examine the files and add another link to download the file again if you want.


- **post-execution.sh**  
  these are the script that run before and after downloads to process and manage the music library.
