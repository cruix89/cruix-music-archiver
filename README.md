## üíñ GENEROSITY

- üòä **if you like me, consider** [buy me a coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com/cruix89)
- üìå **docker hub:** [cruix-music-archiver](https://hub.docker.com/r/cruix89/cruix-music-archiver)  
- üìÑ **yt-dlp documentation:** [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)

## ‚ú®: FEATURES

- **simple setup & usage**  
  default settings for optimal operation configured automatically.
  
- **automatic updates**  
  self-updating container with automatic image creation with each `yt-dlp` release.
  
- **automated downloads**  
  specify a download URL file, and easily manage permissions to download.

- **yt-dlp customization**  
  includes support for SponsorBlock, Geo Bypass, Proxy, Metadata, and more.

- **smart caches and config files**  
  folders, cache and configuration files in the /config directory for full control of execution processes.

- **smart tag search engines by apis**  
  genre, missing covers and artist images automatic search engines

- **smart correction and normalization of tags and files**  
  a large library of patches are applied to standardize and correct filenames and tags

- **tracks number correction engine**  
  some songs may have the wrong or missing track numbers. the system uses a solid database to correct the number of tracks

- **unofficial albums and disambiguation**  
  unofficial albums are moved to a specific directory for library cleanup.  
  artists with ambiguous names are correctly renamed by adding valid information using a disambiguation library

- **LUFS-based normalization**  
  audio processing using [ffmpeg](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg) to calculate the audio LUFS and normalize the entire library,  
  using the same parameters that major streaming platforms use, improving the sound experience and reducing volume differences between different sounds

- **designed for excellent compatibility with large media center projects**  
  the library structure is organized for great viewing on [plex](https://github.com/plexinc/pms-docker) and [jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/installation/container/)
